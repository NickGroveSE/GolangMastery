## Golang Mastery 

Essentially a self taught "course" I made for myself to master Golang. 9 projects ranging from Beginner to Advanced, and each project will an upgraded version I will tackle as well. Follow me as I learn this modern and efficient language.



### Project 1: Letterboxd Web Scraper (*Colly*)

Create a Web Scraper that displays your top 4 favorite films and 4 most recent films (with your rating) from your Letterboxd account. Most of this project was straight forward It just involved documentation reading to used to Colly and educating myself on how query selection works.

### Project 2: Credit Card Validator (*Luhn's Algorithm, HTTP Server, Postman, JSON*)

Using Luhn's Algorithm I needed to validate entry errors with credit card numbers and set up this functionality as a microservice. It felt like I layed a lot of good ground work for my future in Go with this project by being exposed to a lot of new syntax, working with http requests, and handling JSON data.

### Project 3: Create a Pixel Art Editor
